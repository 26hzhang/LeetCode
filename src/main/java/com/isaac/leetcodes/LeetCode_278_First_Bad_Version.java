/**
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
 * product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
 * check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the
 * versions after a bad version are also bad.
 *
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
 * bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 *
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You
 * should minimize the number of calls to the API.
