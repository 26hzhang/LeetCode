 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no

 *         Explain: First Step: Assume the first pointer runs from head at a
 *         speed of 1-by-1 step, as S, and the second pointer runs at a speed of
 *         2-by-2 step, as 2S, then two pointers will meet at MEET-POINT, using
 *         the same time. Define outer loop is A, the distance from
 *         CIRCLE-START-POINT to MEET-POINT is B, and the distance from
 *         MEET-POINT to CIRCLE-START-POINT is C (Apparently, C=loop-B), then (n
 *         * loop + a + b) / 2S = (a + b) / S, n=1,2,3,4,5,....
 *         Converting that equation can get A/S=n loop / S â€“ B / S. Since C =
 *         loop - B, get A/S = ((n-1) loop + C)/S.
 *         That means, as second step, assuming a pointer running from head and
 *         another pointer running from MEET-POINT both at a speed S will meet
 *         at CIRCLE-START-POINT;
