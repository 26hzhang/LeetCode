/**
 * You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of
 * stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones.
 * The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the
 * first turn to remove the stones.
 * Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a
 * function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones
 * in the heap.
 * For example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the
 * game: no matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be
 * removed by your friend.
 *
 * Hint:
 * 1. If there are 5 stones in the heap, could you figure out a way to remove
 * the stones such that you will always be the winner?
