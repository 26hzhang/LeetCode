/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock
 * on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock
 * multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 * • You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * • After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (i.e.,
 * cooldown 1 day)
 *
 * Example:
 * prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
 * maxProfit = 3
 * transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

 *         Explain:
 *         Cooldown也加入更新，因为之前的cooldown对后面有影响，每次选择cooldown和
 *         profit中较大的作为当前的profit。
